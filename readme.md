## Description ##

This project is adding CodeMirror functionality to the Plugin and Theme file editors, as well as the Customizer Custom CSS box and the Custom HTML widget.

This is currently a Work In Progress playground for experimenting with bringing syntax highlighting to WordPress Core.

We're working around discussion on a Core ticket, [#12423](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423)

## Getting Started ##

You can locate a ZIP for this plugin on the [releases page](https://github.com/WordPress/better-code-editing/releases) on GitHub. To install, simply go to your WP Admin and Plugins > Add New. Then click "Upload Plugin" and select the `better-code-editing.zip` you downloaded from the releases page. Then click "Install Now" and on the next screen click "Activate Plugin". _Note on upgrading:_ If you want to update the plugin from a previous version, you must first deactivate it and uninstall it completely and then re-install and re-activate the new version (see [#9757](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/9757) for fixing this).

Otherwise, to set up the plugin for development: clone this repository and run `npm install` to download CodeMirror and other assets.

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins/
git clone --recursive https://github.com/WordPress/better-code-editing.git
cd better-code-editing
npm install
```

Also install the pre-commit hook via:

```bash
cd .git/hooks && ln -s ../../dev-lib/pre-commit pre-commit && cd -
```

Any questions, reach out to #core-customize on WordPress.org Slack or better open an issue on GitHub!

**Development of this plugin is done [on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/better-code-editing). Pull requests welcome. Please see [issues](https://github.com/WordPress/better-code-editing/issues) reported there.**

## Creating a Release ##

Contributors who want to make a new release, follow these steps:

1. Bump plugin versions in `package.json` (×1), `package-lock.json` (×1, just do `npm install` first), `readme.txt` (×1 in `Stable Tag`), and in `better-code-editing.php` (×2: the metadata block in the header and also the `CodeMirror_WP::VERSION` constant).
2. Run `npm run build-release-zip` to create a `better-code-editing.zip` in the plugin's root directory.
3. [Create new release](https://github.com/WordPress/better-code-editing/releases/new) on GitHub targeting `master`, with the new plugin version as the tag and release title, and upload the `better-code-editing.zip` as the associated binary. Publish the release.
