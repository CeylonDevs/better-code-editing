## Description ##

This project is adding CodeMirror functionality to the Plugin and Theme file editors, as well as the Customizer Custom CSS box and the Custom HTML widget.

This is currently a Work In Progress playground for experimenting with bringing syntax highlighting to WordPress Core.

We're working around discussion on a Core ticket, [#12423](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423)

## Getting Started

You can locate a ZIP for this plugin on the [releases page](https://github.com/WordPress/codemirror-wp/releases) on GitHub. To install, simply go to your WP Admin and Plugins > Add New. Then click "Upload Plugin" and select the `codemirror-wp.zip` you downloaded from the releases page. Then click "Install Now" and on the next screen click "Activate Plugin".

Otherwise, to set up the plugin for development: clone this repository and run `npm install` to download CodeMirror and other assets.

```bash

## Creating a Release

Contributors who want to make a new release, follow these steps:

1. Bump plugin versions in `package.json` (×1) and in `codemirror-wp.php` (×2: the metadata block in the header and also the `CodeMirror_WP::VERSION` constant).
2. Run `npm run build-release-zip` to create a `codemirror-wp.zip` in the plugin's root directory.
3. [Create new release](https://github.com/WordPress/codemirror-wp/releases/new) on GitHub targeting `master`, with the new plugin version as the tag and release title, and upload the `codemirror-wp.zip` as the associated binary. Publish the release.
