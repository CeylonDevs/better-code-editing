## Description ##

This project is adding CodeMirror functionality to the Plugin and Theme file editors, as well as the Customizer Custom CSS box and the Custom HTML widget.

This is currently a Work In Progress playground for experimenting with bringing syntax highlighting to WordPress Core.

We're working around discussion on a Core ticket, [#12423](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423)

## Getting Started

Clone this repository, and then build CodeMirror -- the last step is necessary, otherwise the main CodeMirror JS library won't be available to be enqueued.

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/WordPress/codemirror-wp.git
cd codemirror-wp
npm install
```

For simplicity's sake we're running CM as a Git Submodule, rather than duplicating it in this repository.

Any questions, reach out to #core-customize on WordPress.org Slack or better open an issue on GitHub!

**Development of this plugin is done [on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/codemirror-wp). Pull requests welcome. Please see [issues](https://github.com/WordPress/codemirror-wp/issues) reported there.**
